# @leolara Update 2 (Mar-Apr-May 2022)

In my previous update, I mentioned that I wanted to get more involved in a protocol aspect that was more towards the future.

I decided to focus on distributed validators. At our discord server I found #distributed-validators channel, I read the channel history to get a context.

Then I started coolaborating in the Obol/charon distributed validator project and following some contributions for Prysm.

I research about BLS and TSS (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3030  and https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381)
That is used in ECL and Obol/charon

Working on remote signers integration in Obol (https://hackmd.io/@leolara/SkaIPFAS9=) working on making it work with Obol/charon.

Intersted on E2E testing for Obol/charon , I am working on reusing prysm E2E testing for this, and also researching Ethereum Hive for this.

Very important, as well, worked on the review of many obol/charon PRs.

During these more than four months, I have done many contrinutions and I got used to coolaborate on the Ethereum R&D, Prysm and Obol discords
