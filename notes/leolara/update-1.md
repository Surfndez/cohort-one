# @leolara Update 1 (Jan-Feb 2022)

During this period I have tried to start getting a sense of how the PoS cosensus protocol works and also to start contributing to Prysm.

I read the following:

https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/
https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/ffg%2Bghost/paper.pdf
https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec

Also, I read in the code of some Prysm data structures that helped me understand better the beacon chain.

I wouldn't say that I got a complete understanding but it has been a good introduction.

I think I have been more successful in the side of starting to contriubute to Prysm.

I got in touch with the Prysm team, first Raul Jordan, and started communicating in their discord.

I did several contributtions:

https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10252
https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10192
https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10117
https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10116
https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10074
https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10044

Some highlights of this contributions:

+ Porting to Apple M1 processors
+ Renaming to Bellatrix
+ Revamping and extending tests for the state package

I am still working on the last point, but some contributions have been already been made.

Criticism

I think I staied too much in my confort zone of software engineer helping with the code, and I have not evolved enough as a protocol engineer.

Goals for next updates

I want to get more involved in Prysm in the changes that are required for Bellatrix, and I think the Prysm team is going to guide me to do that.

I also want to get involved in some protocol aspect that is more towards the future, for example sharding or state expiry. For that I need to reach more to people in the EF R&D discord.
