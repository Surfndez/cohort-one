## Interests

- Learning more about how protocol should handle MEV

## Notes

- Although many DEXes market themselves as a decentralized exchange, they're mostly custodial at best.

## Research on MEV

## Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)

This is a series of notes related to MEV from various resources from YouTube, Crypto Twitter, to blogs and various sources online. The goal is to do an in-dept research on the subject and build a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for MEV.

## Guide

## Is it an existential threat to Ethereum?

- It is problem for both PoS and PoW.
- Block proposer extractable value
- Inefficient market -> Arbitrage
- Frontrunning other people transactions
- Backrunning
- It is a challenge because UX -> User get less favorable price
- Existencial challenge -> there's economic of scale
    - There's a benefit of centralization
- Economic of scale
    - Have a lot of money - hire goo engineer
- Ecosystem's best reply
    - Firewall the centralization
    - One party create bundles / bundles of transactions (Searchers)
    - Block proposer (miners/validators)
- Economic design philosophy, sometimes you can't get rid of centralization
- This is a problem an now being solved by the ecosystem.
